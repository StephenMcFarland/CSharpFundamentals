            //Brand of car,
            //Model of car,
            //We need to know the Year of the car,
            //Classification or Type(truck, suv, sedan, etc),
            //We need to know the Color, 
            //we need to know how many Wheels it has, 
            //if it has been in a Accident,
            //we also want to know how many Owners it has had.

            //Once you have created a Car class unit test making an instance of the car.
            //Make a New Unit Test Project and name it Insurance_Tests
            //Make one test method that you call the car properties and set values for each one.
            //Example
            Car carOne = new Car();
            carOne.Brand = "Autobots";
            carOne.Model = "Camaro";

            carOne.Wheels = 4;
            carOne.HadAccident = true;
            carOne.Owners = 0;

            //Than make a new test method and unit test using a overloaded constructor
            //When you create a constructor with parameters your test will fail. Why? Fix It.
            //Example
            Car carTwo = new Car("AutoBots","Camaro", 1984, "Car", "Yellow", 4, true, 0);

            //If you finish this create a Car Repository that will hold methods related to the car.
            //For right now create a method that will increase or decrease the amount of insurance based on year.
            // If it was made in 
            //1960 - 1970 cost will be $50 
            //1971 - 1980 cost will be $75
            //1981 - 1991 cost will be $150
            //Everything else will be $2000
            //Example
            //BONUS but the bonus only comes with a pat on the back...create methods that adds a car to a list, gets a list and unit test those methods.
